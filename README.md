# Automation Testing Tool With AI

## What is this repository all about?
As we has already knew about automation testing, the QA engineer have to define their steps into BDD source all the times and sometimes it's kinda waste time a bit because there are several projects didn't have their own test cases, so the automation QA have to define by themselves. 

So for this one, we are thinking about making a system like that, using with AI to generate the test BDD based on the scenario we want to have. It's going to be crazy
